GlobalChem API
==============

The global chem api is very basic and is essentially just storing variables as properties on the class.

The GlobalChem Class
--------------------

Below is the content store of what variables exist on GlobalChem - feel free to add your own as well!

.. attribute:: amino_acid_side_chains

  returns a dictionary of SMILES representations of amino acid side chains labeled appropiately minus proline

.. attribute:: functional_groups_smiles

  returns a dictionary of SMILES representation of a variety of functional groups. Still working on the expansion but as far as I got.

.. attribute:: functional_groups_smarts

  returns a dictionary of SMARTS representation of a variety of functional groups. Still working on the expansion but as far as I got.
